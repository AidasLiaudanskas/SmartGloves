# SmartGloves
Third year project at the Cambridge University Department of Engineering (CUED).

We (me and [Luke Wren](https://github.com/wren6991)) have created a pair of gloves that can track the user's hand and finger motions in a 3D simulated computer environment.

We have used BLE Nano microcontroller by Red Bear Labs. Code for it is written in C++ using ARM mbed library.

The 3D simulation was written by Luke using Unity.

The pdf file included in this repo describes the project in detail.

The project was rated 94%
